# Against Bitrot (How & why I rebuilt my blog)

> The Jargon File, a compendium of hacker lore, defines "bit rot" as a jocular explanation for the degradation of a software program over time even if "nothing has changed"; the idea behind this is almost as if the bits that make up the program were subject to radioactive decay.

## Intro rant (the 'why')
I am writing this late at night, tired of our industry's acceptance of "bit rot".

I built my [Gatsby based blog](https://elvischidera.com) using a template over 4 years ago. I haven't touched the codebase much since I published the blog. Content is king, so I focused on just writing markdown files.

Fast forward to today. After a long while, I tried building my blog locally and it failed. There were so many warnings and errors to fill multiple pages.

Last I checked markdown, HTML, CSS, Javascript hasn't changed significantly. So, what gives?

I had a look at my local `node_modules` and there were over 1000 dependencies.

Like bruv! I just want to write in markdown and have it show up on the internet. I don't want to be a "professional engineer" on my hobbies! If I want to do that, I'll go back to work.

I was incurring the cost for things I don't give a fudge about. I saw Python in one of the error logs, why do I need Python to build the blog? Why do I need networking dependencies?

## Blog setup (the 'how')
I was having an itch to move to different tooling. But I didn't want the same problem in the future. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a tool that was as simple as I wanted.

There are only four features I care about:
1. Markdown to HTML conversion.
2. Syntax highlighting for code blocks.
3. Support for Latex.
4. A simple way to deploy this static blog.

Whatever these other tools were selling, I wasn't buying. My requirements haven't changed in the last 4 years, and I don't think it will change in the next 10 years (unless there is a fundamental shift in how the internet works).

I found this [blog template](https://github.com/gordonnl/markdown-blog-template). The last commit was 5 years ago. I pulled it and it still worked.

Parfait!
