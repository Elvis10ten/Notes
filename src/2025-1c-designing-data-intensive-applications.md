# [WIP] Designing Data-Intensive Applications

This book is a journey through both the principles and the practicalities of data systems (like databases, caches, search indexes, stream processing, batch processing, etc.),
and how to use them to build data-intensive applications.

Data-intensive applications are defined as applications where raw CPU power is rarely the limiting factor.
Instead, the primary issues of these applications are usually:
* The amount of data
* The complexity of data and
* The speed at which data is changing
