This repo powers my [notes site](https://notes.elvischidera.com).

It was inspired by this [repo](https://github.com/gordonnl/markdown-blog-template).

My goal is to create a software rust resistant blog. I don't want to touch any of the tooling in the future. I just want to write markdown notes, not fight with the tools.
