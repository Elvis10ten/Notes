<li>Modern cryptography employs a combination of:<ul>
<li>Conventional or <strong>symmetric cryptographic</strong> systems for encrypting data and</li>
<li>Public key or <strong>asymmetric systems</strong> for managing the keys used by the symmetric systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Encryption is accomplished by scrambling data using mathematical procedures that make it extremely difficult and time-consuming for anyone other than authorized recipients — those with the correct decryption keys — to recover the plain text.</li>
<li>A cryptographic algorithm is considered strong if:<ul>
<li>No shortcut allows the opponent to recover the plain text without using brute force to test keys until the correct one is found and</li>
<li>The number of possible keys is sufficiently large to make such an attack infeasible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The sizes of encryption keys are measured in bits and the difficulty of trying all possible keys grows exponentially with the number of bits used.</li>
<li>Public key or <strong>asymmetric cryptosystems</strong> have the property that the ability to encrypt does not imply the ability to decrypt.</li>
<li>Conventional or <strong>symmetric cryptosystems</strong> — those in which an entity with the ability to encrypt also can decrypt and vice versa — are the systems under consideration in this paper.</li>
<li>It’s a property of computer encryption that modest increases in computational cost can produce vast increases in security: Encrypting information very securely (e.g with 128-bit keys) typically requires little more computing than encrypting it weakly (e.g with 40-bit key keys)</li>
<li>It is the nature of brute-force attacks that they can be parallelized indefinitely.</li>
<li>FPGAs function as programmable hardware and allow faster implementations of such tasks as encryption and decryption than conventional processors.</li>
<li>There are smarter avenues of attack than brute force: There is no need to break the window of a house to get in if the front door is unlocked. Calculations regarding the strength of encryption against brute-force attacks are <strong>worst-case scenarios</strong>.</li>
<li>The authors&#39; recommendation at the time the paper was written (1996):<blockquote>
<p>To provide adequate protection against the most serious threats — well-funded commercial enterprises or government intelligence agencies — keys used to protect data today should be at least <code>75 bits long</code>. To protect information adequately for the next <code>20 years</code> in<br>the face of expected advances in computing, keys in newly-developed systems should be at-least <code>90 bits long</code>.</p>
