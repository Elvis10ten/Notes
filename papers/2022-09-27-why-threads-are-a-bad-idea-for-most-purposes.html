    <h1>Why Threads Are A Bad Idea (for most purposes)</h1>
<p>Today&#39;s summary is about a  <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/threads.pdf">paper</a> written by John Ousterhout in 1995. This is technically not a paper, but a presentation given by the author at a Usenix conference.</p>

<li>Threads are independent execution streams that shared state (memory) and are often preemptively scheduled by the OS/runtime.</li>
<li>Threads are too hard for most programmers because:<ul>
<li><strong>Synchronization</strong>: access to shared data must be coordinated with locks.</li>
<li><strong>Deadlock</strong>: Circular dependencies among locks.</li>
<li><strong>Hard to debug</strong>: data dependencies, timing dependencies.</li>
<li><strong>Threads break abstraction</strong>: can&#39;t design modules independently.</li>
<li>Callbacks don&#39;t work with locks.</li>
<li><strong>Locks trade-off</strong>: Coarse-grain locking yields low concurrency; Fine-grain locking increases complexity and locking overhead.</li>
<li><strong>OSes limit performance</strong>: scheduling, context switches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Event-driven programming:<ul>
<li>One execution stream: no CPU concurrency.</li>
<li>Register interest in events (callbacks).</li>
<li>Event loop waits for events and invokes handlers.</li>
<li>No preemption of event handlers.</li>
<li>Handlers are generally short-lived.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Events are used in most GUIs:<ul>
<li>One handler for each event (press button, invoke menu entry, etc.).</li>
<li>Handler implements behavior (undo, delete a file, etc.).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Problems with events:<ul>
<li>Long-running handlers make the application non-responsive.</li>
<li>Can&#39;t maintain local state across events (handler must return).</li>
<li>No CPU concurrency.</li>
<li>Event-driven I/O not always well supported (e.g. poor write buffering).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Events vs Threads:<ul>
<li>Events avoid concurrency as much as possible, threads embrace.</li>
<li>Debugging is easier with events.</li>
<li>Events are faster than threads on a single CPU because of no context switching or locking overhead.</li>
<li>Threads provide true concurrency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The conclusion is to avoid threads wherever possible:<ul>
<li>Use events, not threads, for GUIs, distributed systems, low-end servers, etc.</li>
<li>Only use threads where true CPU concurrency is needed.</li>
<li>Where threads are needed, isolate usage in threaded application kernel: keep most of the code single-threaded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
