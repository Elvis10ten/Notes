<li>This paper discusses modularization as a mechanism for improving the flexibility and comprehensibility of a system while allowing the shortening of its development time.</li>
<li>The effectiveness of a &quot;modularization&quot; is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the system into modules.</li>
<li>Point (2) buttresses the idea that it’s not about having “small” modules — however a module size is measured.</li>
<li>Expected benefits of modular programming:<ul>
<li>Managerial — development time should be shortened because separate groups would work on each module with little need for communication.</li>
<li>Product flexibility — it should be possible to make drastic changes to one module without a need to change others.</li>
<li>Comprehensibility — it should be possible to study the system one module at a time with the result that the whole system could be better designed because it was better understood.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The author shows two ways to decompose an example software project.<ul>
<li><strong>First strategy</strong>:<ul>
<li>In the first decomposition the criterion used was to make each major step in the processing a module.</li>
<li>This is the most common approach to decomposition or modularization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Second strategy</strong>:<ul>
<li>The second decomposition was made using &#39;fin- formation hiding&quot; [4] as a criterion.</li>
<li>Every module in the second decomposition is characterized by its knowledge of a design decision which it hides from all others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The order in time in which processing is expected to take place should not be used in making the decomposition into modules.</li>
<li>Hierarchical structure and &quot;clean&quot; decomposition are two desirable but independent properties of a system structure.</li>
<li>The author concludes with:<blockquote>
<p>We have tried to demonstrate by these examples that it is <strong>almost always incorrect to begin the decomposition of a system into modules based on a flowchart</strong>. We propose instead that one begins with a list of difficult design decisions or design decisions that are likely to change. Each module is then designed to hide such a decision from the others.</p>
