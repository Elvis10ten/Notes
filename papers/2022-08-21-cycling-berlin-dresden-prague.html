    <h1>Solo Cycling Adventure: Berlin → Dresden → Prague</h1>
<p>Two weeks ago, I embarked on an audacious cycling adventure — cycling alone from Berlin to Prague (~360km). Prior to the trip, I had only done ~70km max (with company).</p>
<p><img src="assets/banner.png" alt="Banner"></p>
<p>It was a fantabulous adventure: I improved my physical and mental strength; Interacted with beautiful people, geographies &amp; cultures en route; and I feel great overall (<a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/natural-high">natural high</a>).</p>
<p><img src="assets/types_of_fun.jpg" alt="Types of fun"></p>
<p>Having tasted the sweetness of long-distance cycling, my eyes are set on Amsterdam, Copenhagen, or a town in Poland next.</p>
<p>In this post, I will succinctly share how I planned for the trip and how it went.</p>

<i><small>Party in Prague</small></i>

<h2>📜 Planning</h2>
<h4>🌍 Route</h4>
<p>I made a 3-day plan that spanned across 3 distinct cities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin">Berlin</a> 🇩🇪 → <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottbus">Cottbus</a> 🇩🇪</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottbus">Cottbus</a> 🇩🇪 → <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden">Dresden</a> 🇩🇪</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden">Dresden</a> 🇩🇪 → <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague">Prague</a> 🇨🇿</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="assets/plan_whiteboard.jpg" alt="Original plan on a whiteboard"></p>
<p>I spent a few hours studying the terrain and modifying the route on a satellite map. My goal was to always be within a few kilometers of some human settlement — in case of an emergency.</p>
<h4>🚴‍♂️ Cycling gear</h4>
<p>Up to this point, I had mostly cycled casually: In normal clothes, on a normal bike.</p>
<p><img src="assets/ex_gear.jpg" alt="Ex gear"></p>
<p>This wasn&#39;t gonna fly for an international trip because of safety, performance, and other concerns. I bought the <a href="https://www.bergamont.com/at/de/product/bergamont-grandurance-4">Bergamont Grandurance 4</a> and a few other &quot;serious&quot; cycling gear.</p>
<p><img src="assets/cur_gear.jpg" alt="Current gear"></p>
<h4>🛡 Tactical gear</h4>
<p>I&#39;m cognizant of east Germany&#39;s risk profile. While I will try my best to avoid any conflict, I was prepared for the worst — because the fact that you don&#39;t want a fight, doesn&#39;t mean a fight doesn&#39;t want you. I won&#39;t go into the details of my self-defense gear (but it wasn&#39;t pepper spray).</p>
<p>Also, one of my phones was set up to constantly capture sensor data (including location &amp; audio) and upload it in near real-time. I asked my close friends to periodically check in on these.</p>
<h4>🥗 Supplies</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Water</strong>: I had a capacity of 2.5L.</li>
<li><strong>Food</strong>: I packed protein bars, nuts, bread, plantain chips, banana, and a few fruits. This was hard as I&#39;m used to eating fresh home-cooked meals.
<img src="assets/foods.jpg" alt="Food"></li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong>: I had two backup phones, two power banks, an inner tube, an adhesive patch, a mini pump, and a few other cycling tools.
<img src="assets/tools.jpg" alt="Tools"></li>
</ul>
<p>I planned on stopping at grocery stores to refill both the water and food supplies.</p>
<h2>⚙️ Execution</h2>
<h4>🌳 Day-1 (The road to <del>Cottbus</del> Luckau)</h4>
<p>I started very late, so I had to scrap the plan of going to Cottbus. Postponing to the next day would have interfered with my weekend plans for Prague 🤪, so I decided to go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luckau">Luckau</a> which is a small city in Brandenburg.</p>
<p>I had to cycle late at night. For safety reasons I stopped stopping to take photos or use the camera as it got darker. There were lots of beautiful sights that I didn&#39;t capture — especially the windmills with the sunset as their background.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I noticed something interesting in a town 30km from Luckau: There was a table with fruits in front of a house (no one was watching it). I saw a couple taking some of the fruits and leaving what appeared to be money. Maybe someone can tell me more about this?</p>

<h4>🏰 Day-2 (The road to Dresden)</h4>
<p>I slept in a stranger&#39;s place at the end of day-1 🧐. The next morning, she made breakfast for me and we talked about my journey 😊 (nice &amp; kind). The often stated &quot;nice or kind&quot; expression confounds me as I&#39;m not aware of any laws that preclude both from co-existing.</p>
<p>Day-2 was about getting to Dresden ASAP so I can cycle around the city during the day. I wanted to be focused on the moment and get to Dresden fast which meant I took fewer photos overall.</p>

<h4>🏔 Day-3 (The road to Prague)</h4>
<p>I was so focused on getting to Prague early in day-3 that most things were a blur. Some of the photos are included in the photo dump section below.</p>
<h2>🍾 Party in Prague</h2>
<p>Prague was incredibly fun. I arrived on Saturday and met with my friend. We spent the day doing the usual boring touristy stuff like taking pictures. We spent Saturday and Sunday nights partying.</p>
<p>The city was beautiful and I wished I could have spent more time there. I should be back again.</p>

<h2>🎒 Return trip</h2>
<p>I was gonna cycle back to Dresden and then take the bus to Berlin. But I lost my small bag in Litomèrice. It had my passport, IDs, credit card, some euros, and 100 CZK.</p>
<p>I called the police after a few hours of unsuccessful searching. Fortunately, someone had given the bag to the police so I went to the police station to pick it up. Unfortunately, all the cash was stolen. Given the signals I got, I bet that it was the police officer that took the money, but I let it go as I was in no mood for an argument at this point.</p>
<p>After this fiasco, I decided to just take a bus from Czech instead.</p>
