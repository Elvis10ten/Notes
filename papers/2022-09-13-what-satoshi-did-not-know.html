<p>Today&#39;s summary is about a <a href="https://www.ifca.ai/pub/fc15/89750001.pdf">paper</a> written by Gavin Andresen in 2015. Gavin has been working on bitcoin since 2010.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that each statement was flavored with “I think”. For each item, Gavin provides reasons for why he thinks so in the paper.</p>

<ol>
<li>Would it bootstrap?</li>
<li>How annoying people are on the Internet: <ul>
<li>How willing people would be to abuse things, even if there is absolutely no economic incentive for doing so.</li>
<li>Early in Bitcoin’s life there was a big problem called “penny­-ﬂooding”.</li>
<li>Penny-ﬂooding works as follows: Set up two machines and send bitcoins from one to the other all day long to flood the network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It’s likely Satoshi was not a cryptographer given:<ul>
<li>Minimal cryptography in Bitcoin: ECC keys, ECDSA signatures, and hashing.</li>
<li>Naivety of the (earlier) code around OpenSSL.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Diﬀerence between Transaction validity and meaning.</li>
<li>How to scale the system.</li>
<li>Recent Cryptography Results: because they didn’t exist at the time the system was created.</li>
</ol>
