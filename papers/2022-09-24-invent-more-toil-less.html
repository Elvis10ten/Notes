    <h1>Invent More, Toil Less — Paper Summary</h1>
<p>Today&#39;s summary is about a  <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/login_fall16_08_beyer.pdf">paper</a>  written by four Google employees in 2016.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Toil is the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be:<ul>
<li>Manual</li>
<li>Repetitive</li>
<li>Automatable and not requiring human judgment</li>
<li>Interrupt-­driven and reactive</li>
<li>Of no enduring value</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Work with enduring value leaves a service permanently better, whereas toil is “running fast to stay in the same place.” </li>
<li>Google top sources of toil:<ul>
<li>Interrupts (non­-urgent service­ related messages and emails).</li>
<li>On­call (urgent) responses</li>
<li>Releases and pushes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Toil is ONLY invariantly bad in large amounts because it can lead to career stagnation and low morale.</li>
<li>SRE engineering work tends to fall into two categories:<ul>
<li><strong>Software engineering</strong>: Involves writing or modifying code, in addition to any associated design and documentation work.</li>
<li><strong>Systems engineering</strong>: Involves configuring production systems, modifying configurations, or documenting systems in a way that produces lasting improvements from a one-­time effort.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The paper briefly outlined how the BigTable team was able to minimize toil around 2014. This involved:<ul>
<li>Incremental progress in automation.</li>
<li>Sacrificing short-term goals for long-term goals. E.g: In the short term, they said “no” to some support requests and encouraged people to evaluate the merits of a request before requesting.<blockquote>
<p>In the long run, customers value a reliable, predictable interface offered by a healthy team more than they value a request queue that processes any and every request, be it standard or an unconventional one­off, in an <strong>inde­terminate amount of time</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Best Practices for Reducing Toil</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Buy-in is key</strong>: To tackle toil in a meaningful way, management must support the idea that toil reduction is a worthwhile goal.</li>
<li><strong>Minimize Unique Requirements</strong><blockquote>
<p>Using the “pets vs. cattle” analogy discussed in a [2013 UK Register article](<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/03/18">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/03/18</a> /servers_pets_or_cattle_cern/), your systems should be automated, easily interchangeable, replaceable, and low­ maintenance (cattle); they should not have unique requirements for human care and atten­tion (pets).  </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Invest in Build/Test/Release Infrastructure Early</strong>: Standardization and automation pay off in the long run.</li>
<li><strong>Audit Your Monitoring Regularly</strong>: Establish a regular feedback loop to evaluate signal versus noise in your monitoring setup. </li>
<li><strong>Conduct Postmortems</strong>: Docs should be blameless and actionable.</li>
<li><strong>No Haunted Graveyards</strong>: Companies usually have parts of the code that are deemed “too risky to change”. The goal is to control trouble, not to avoid it at all costs.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Any team tasked with operational work will necessarily be burdened with some degree of toil.  </p>
<p>While toil can never be com­pletely eliminated, it can and should be thoughtfully mitigated to ensure the long­-term health of the team responsible for this work.  </p>
<p>When operational work is left unchecked, it naturally grows over time to consume 100% of a team’s resources.  </p>
<p>Engi­neers and teams performing an SRE or DevOps role owe it to themselves to focus relentlessly on reducing toil — not as a luxury, but as a necessity for survival.</p>
