    <h1>The Value of Science — Paper Summary</h1>
<p>Today&#39;s summary is about a  <a href="https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/1575/1/Science.pdf">paper</a>  written by RP Feynman in 1955.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of all its many values, the greatest must be the freedom to doubt.  </p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>The challenge of social problems for a scientist is that they are harder than scientific problems.</li>
<li>Scientists don&#39;t have any magic formula for solving problems.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The values of science</h2>
<ol>
<li>Scientific knowledge enables us to do and make all kinds of things.</li>
<li>The fun called intellectual enjoyment which some people get from reading, learning, thinking, and working on it.<blockquote>
<p>The imagination of nature is far greater than the imagination of man.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>The scientist has a lot of experience with <strong>ignorance</strong>, <strong>doubt</strong>, and <strong>uncertainty</strong>. The author thinks this experience is of vital importance.<ul>
<li>When a scientist doesn&#39;t know the answer to a problem, he is ignorant.</li>
<li>When he has a hunch as to what the result is he is uncertain.</li>
<li>And when he is pretty darn sure of what the result is going to be, he is in some doubt.</li>
<li>It has been found that it is of paramount importance that to progress we must recognize the ignorance and leave room for doubt.</li>
<li>Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty — Some most unsure, some nearly sure, none absolutely certain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Our responsibility is to do what we can, learn what we can, improve the solutions, and pass them on. It is our responsibility to leave the men of the future a free hand. In the impetuous youth of humanity, we can make grave errors that can stunt our growth for a long time. This we will do if we say we have the answers now, so young and ignorant; if we suppress all discussion, all criticism, saying, &quot;This is it, boys, man is saved!&#39; and thus doom man for a long time to the chains of authority, confined to the limits of our present imagination. It has been done so many times before.  </p>
