    <h1>Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming — Book Summary</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Six blind sages were shown an elephant and met to discuss their experience.
“It’s wonderful,” said the first, “an elephant is like a rope: slender and flexible.
” “No, no, not at all,” said the second, “an elephant is like a tree: sturdily planted on the ground.”
“Marvelous,” said the third, “an elephant is like a wall.”
“Incredible,” said the fourth, “an elephant is a tube filled with water.”
“What a strange piecemeal beast this is,” said the fifth.
“Strange indeed,” said the sixth, “but there must be some underlying harmony. Let us investigate the matter further.”
– Freely adapted from a traditional Indian fable</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A programming language is like a natural, human language in that it favors certain metaphors, images, and ways of thinking.
– Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas, Seymour Papert (1980)</p>
