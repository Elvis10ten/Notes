<li>The author introduces a novel type of cryptographic scheme, which enables any pair of users to communicate securely and to verify each other&#39;s signatures without exchanging private or public keys, without keeping key directories, and without using the services of a third party.</li>
<li>The scheme is based on a public key cryptosystem with an extra twist: Instead of generating a random pair of public/private keys and publishing one of these keys, the user chooses a combination of identifiers as their <strong>public key</strong>. Example identifier combination: name and network address.</li>
<li>The identifiers chosen must satisfy two conditions:<ul>
<li>It uniquely identifies the user in a way they cannot later deny.</li>
<li>Itâ€™s readily available to the other party.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The scheme assumes the existence of trusted key generation centers, whose sole purpose is to give each user their <strong>private key</strong> when they first join the network.</li>
<li>When <code>user A</code> wants to send a message to <code>user B</code>:<ul>
<li>He signs the message with his secret key.</li>
<li>Adds his <code>own identifier</code> (e.g: name and network address) to the result.</li>
<li>Encrypts the result by using <code>B&#39;s identifier</code>.</li>
<li>Sends it to <code>B</code>.</li>
<li>When <code>B</code> receives the message, he decrypts it using his secret key.</li>
<li>Then verifies the signature by using the sender&#39;s identifier as a verification key.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The secret keys must be computed by a key generation center rather than by the users since there is nothing special about a user&#39;s identity: If <code>user A</code> could compute the secret key that corresponds to the <code>public key &quot;A&quot;</code>, he could also compute the secret keys that correspond to the <code>public keys &quot;B&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;C&quot;</code>, etc.</li>
<li>The overall security of the scheme depends on the following points:<ul>
<li>The security of the underlying cryptographic functions.</li>
<li>The secrecy of the privileged information stored at the key generation centers.</li>
<li>The thoroughness of the identity checks performed by the centers before they issue keys.</li>
<li>The precautions taken by users to prevent the unauthorized use of their keys.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In identity-based schemes, the encryption key is the user&#39;s identity, and the decryption key is derived from the user&#39;s identity and a random seed.</li>
</ol>
