<li>This paper suggests that reliability issues endemic in modern distributed systems are as much a sign of market failures as of product deficiencies or vendor negligence:<blockquote>
<p>Our contention is that the “hidden hand” [i.e: market forces] explains a series of market failures impacting products in the field of software reliability.  If reliability solutions are to reach mainstream developers, greater attention must be paid to market economics and drivers. </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Some of the solutions offered to real-world reliability problems:<ul>
<li>Transactions and related atomicity mechanisms:<ul>
<li>Transactions and other notions of atomicity offered a solution to developers: under the (non-trivial!) assumption that data is stored in persistent objects identifiable to the system (database records, Java beans, etc), transactions offer a way to write programs “as if” each application runs on an idle system.</li>
<li>The market rejected the casual use of transactions that access multiple servers because of its complexity/cost.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reliable multicast.</li>
<li>The theory of distributed computing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Based on the authors&#39; experiences, they believe market acceptance of reliability technology has something to do with the technology, but far more to do with:<ul>
<li>Impact on the total cost of building, deploying, and operating ”whole story” solutions.</li>
<li>Credibility of the long-term vision and process.</li>
<li>Compatibility with standard practice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Revisiting a problem in a more realistic context, helps research establish its practical value.</li>
<li>The authors go into length about why so past reliability solutions had failed and how some failed solutions were made commercially successful by embracing market concerns (like practicality).</li>
<li>The authors also make recommendations for researchers that want to have a commercial impact.</li>
</ol>
