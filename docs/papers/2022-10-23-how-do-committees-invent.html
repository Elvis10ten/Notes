<li>The basic thesis of this article is that organizations that design systems are constrained to produce designs that are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.</li>
<li>There is no such thing as a design group that is both organized and unbiased:<blockquote>
<p>Given any design team organization, there is a class of design alternatives that cannot be effectively pursued by such an organization because the necessary communication paths do not exist.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>The very act of organizing a design team means that certain design decisions have already been made, explicitly or otherwise.</li>
<li>There&#39;s never enough time to do something right, but there&#39;s always enough time to do it over.</li>
<li>Any system of consequence is structured from smaller subsystems that are interconnected.</li>
<li>Each subsystem can be viewed also as a system made up of smaller subsystems.</li>
<li>An organization that is not completely flexible in its communication structure will stamp out an image of itself in every design it produces.</li>
<li>Measurement of resources which arises from conventional accounting theory necessitates all resources to be measured using units of measurement which are convertible to the unit of resource (i.e: the dollar).</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>One fallacy behind this calculation is the property of linearity which says that two men working for a year or one hundred men working for a week (at the same hourly cost per man) are resources of equal value.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Ways must be found to reward design managers for keeping their organizations lean and flexible. As long as the manager&#39;s prestige and power are tied to the size of his budget, he will be motivated to expand his organization.</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Probably the greatest single common factor behind many poorly designed systems now in existence has been the availability of a design organization in need of work.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>There is a need for a philosophy of system design management that is not based on the assumption that adding manpower simply adds to productivity.</li>
