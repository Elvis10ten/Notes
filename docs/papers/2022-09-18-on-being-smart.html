<p>Today&#39;s summary is about a  <a href="https://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~matousek/mustafa-onbeingsmart.pdf">paper</a>  written by Nabil H. Mustafa.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>The author argues that persistence/hard work is the crucial parameter for success in graduate school, instead of just intelligence. Intelligence only matters to a level.</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>In the current environment, everyone wants to be smart, or at any rate, appear smart.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>This severely interferes with learning, naturally: students who consider being smart important become more conservative in the length and hardness of problems they attempt, which is a reasonable risk-averse way of preserving their image.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>When students eventually enter the real world (like graduate school), this risk-averse strategy usually doesn’t suffice, which leads to demotivation and procrastination.<blockquote>
<p>Procrastination kicks in, and soon the student is busy with a diverse set of academic (but non-research!) activities to hide the reality of not working, like writing complicated scripts to automate their soon-to-be-coming publication phase, optimizing their daily vitamin B12 intake, getting heavily involved with political and religious movements and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>The author uses Andrew Wiles, Laszlo Polgar, and a few others to buttress his point.</li>
<li>Finally, he references an experiment done by NYMag, where one group of students were told: “you must have really worked hard”; and the other group was told: “you must be smart at this”.</li>
<li>The first group was more likely to choose harder problems, were scrappier in trying various solutions, etc.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The brain is ultimately just a muscle. Make it stronger by working it out.</p>
