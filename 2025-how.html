    <h1>Against Bitrot (How &amp; why I rebuilt my blog)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The Jargon File, a compendium of hacker lore, defines &quot;bit rot&quot; as a jocular explanation for the degradation of a software program over time even if &quot;nothing has changed&quot;; the idea behind this is almost as if the bits that make up the program were subject to radioactive decay.</p>

<h2>Intro rant (the &#39;why&#39;)</h2>
<p>I am writing this late at night, tired of our industry&#39;s acceptance of &quot;bit rot&quot;.</p>
<p>I built my <a href="https://elvischidera.com">Gatsby based blog</a> using a template over 4 years ago. I haven&#39;t touched the codebase much since I published the blog. Content is king, so I focused on just writing markdown files.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today. After a long while, I tried building my blog locally and it failed. There were so many warnings and errors to fill multiple pages.</p>
<p>Last I checked markdown, HTML, CSS, Javascript hasn&#39;t changed significantly. So, what gives?</p>
<p>I had a look at my local <code>node_modules</code> and there were over 1000 dependencies.</p>
<p>Like bruv! I just want to write in markdown and have it show up on the internet. I don&#39;t want to be a &quot;professional engineer&quot; on my hobbies! If I want to do that, I&#39;ll go back to work.</p>
<p>I was incurring the cost for things I don&#39;t give a fudge about. I saw Python in one of the error logs, why do I need Python to build the blog? Why do I need networking dependencies?</p>
<h2>Blog setup (the &#39;how&#39;)</h2>
<p>I was having an itch to move to different tooling. But I didn&#39;t want the same problem in the future. Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t find a tool that was as simple as I wanted.</p>
<p>There are only four features I care about:</p>
<ol>
<li>Markdown to HTML conversion.</li>
<li>Syntax highlighting for code blocks.</li>
<li>Support for Latex.</li>
<li>A simple way to deploy this static blog.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whatever these other tools were selling, I wasn&#39;t buying. My requirements haven&#39;t changed in the last 4 years, and I don&#39;t think it will change in the next 10 years (unless there is a fundamental shift in how the internet works).</p>
<p>I found this <a href="https://github.com/gordonnl/markdown-blog-template">blog template</a>. The last commit was 5 years ago. I pulled it and it still worked.</p>
<p>Parfait! </p>
